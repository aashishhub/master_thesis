This repository consists a jupyter notebook that I used during my master's thesis in Animal Breeding and Genomics at Wageningen University and Research. The title of my thesis was " Variants in gene related to oligosaccharides in pig milk".

This repository consists of a jupyter notebook along with other pipeline for various analysis that includes PCA, parsing the VCF file, subsetting the vcf file, updating vcf file, annotating variants with VEP, phasing, haplotypes analysis, tajima D, Nucleotide diversity etc.
